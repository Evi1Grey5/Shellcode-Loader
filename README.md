### Bypass EDR/AV [LOADER] ShellCode
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79141d44-a040-4afd-88db-b90fc309a85a" width="550" height="550">
This project illustrates a method for circumventing modern security defenses, including AV/EDR solutions, by exploiting Windows API functions to inject a malicious payload directly into a process's memory space. This allows the payload to remain undetected while establishing a connection with a remote system, enabling remote access and control.

__________
- Open the project in Visual Studio or use the following command to compile the code using .NET SDK:
```
csc shellcodeloader.cs /
csc loader_update.cs / 
```

**Alternatively, you can compile in Release mode for better optimization:
```
csc -optimize
```

To avoid detection by advanced EDR solutions, consider using methods such as process injection, obfuscation, or AMSI bypasses.
